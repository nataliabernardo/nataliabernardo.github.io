Hello! Welcome to my blog!

<img src="/assets/img/author.png" width="50%">

I am a Seattle-based data scientist at Metis.

Previously, I worked as a Data Analyst and Economic Consultant for 5 years, designing regulatory policies and tariff for public utilities through econometric techniques. The extensive quantitative analysis learned from this experience sparked my interest in experimenting with more tools to find patterns in data, and to identify the most appropriate method for solving a problem. 

In this blog you will find my projects. As you can see, my knowledge includes statistics, programming, economic modeling and machine learning for different industries. I'm highly motivated and always eager to keep learning.

If you have questions and/or thoughts on anything you find here, feel free to contact me.
